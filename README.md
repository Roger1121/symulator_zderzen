# symulator_zderzen
Project from physics created in high school, animation presenting a crash of the two balls with weight and speed given by user. Programm allows simulation of perfectly resilient and inresilient crashes.
Simulation based on OpenGL engine and freeglut library. Unfirtunately, I've lost the code and I'm left only with exe file.
